===================================<br />
<br />
Use analytics.js (GA Universal Analytics) with Ludei's CocoonJS Canvas+ apps by making use of the WebView<br />
No external hosting is needed anymore.<br />
<br />
To use:<br />
1) Download http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js and add contents to file analytics.js.<br />
2) Set up a new property in Google Analytics to track a mobile app.<br />
3) Modify the web property ID (UA-#) in index.html<br />
4) Test it on your phone using Canvas+ environment on your CocoonJS Launcher.<br />
5) Your ScreenView should be visible in your real-time Google Analytics report.<br />
<br />
